      <p class="heading">Our Methodology</p><br><br>
      <p class="subtext">ZER0trace utilizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800- 88, Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization as the primary framework for our service offering. NIST developed the guideline in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., Public Law 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines for use by the private industry as well as the public sector, including minimum requirements for Federal information systems, but does not apply to national security systems.<br><br>We like new technology as much as anyone and we use a lot of it in ITAD. While so much energy is put into new technology, we focus on what happens to old IT assets. More specifically, putting the systems and processes in place to safely destroy the private and sensitive information contained in your technology assets. We understand that taking an “out of sight out of mind” approach is risky and dangerous on too many levels. We partner with organizations that are serious about proper IT disposal and protecting their company’s data “DNA” that exists in its hardware until destructed.</p>
