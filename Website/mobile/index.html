NIST developed the guideline in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. Â§ 3541 et seq., Public Law 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines for use by the private industry as well as the public sector, including minimum requirements for Federal information systems, but does not apply to national security systems. </p>
